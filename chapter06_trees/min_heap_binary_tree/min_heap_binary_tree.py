# One important variation of a queue is called a priority queue. A priority queue acts like a queue in that you dequeue
# an item by removing it from the front. However, in a priority queue the logical order of items inside a queue is
# determined by their priority. The highest priority items are at the front of the queue and the lowest priority items
# are at the back.

# The classic way to implement a priority queue is using a data structure called a binary heap. A binary heap will
# allow us both enqueue and dequeue items in O(log(n)). The binary heap is interesting to study because when we diagram
# the heap it looks a lot like a tree, but when we implement it we use only a single list as an internal representation.

# Because the tree is complete, the left child of a parent (at position p) is the node that is found in position 2p
# in the list. Similarly, the right child of the parent is at position 2p + 1 in the list. To find the parent of any
# node in the tree, we can simply use Pythonâ€™s integer division. Given that a node is at position n in the list, the
# parent is at position n/2.
